# FastAPI Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python FastAPI project. In this sample, we use `fastapi` to build a web application and the `pytest` to run tests.

For a more in-depth tutorial, see our [Fast API tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-fastapi).

The code in this repo aims to follow Python style guidelines as outlined in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
